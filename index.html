	<h1>What are good wines made of?</h1>
	<div class="intro">
		<p class="intro">
			Although the quality of wine is a subjective question and partially a matter of taste, many good wines still share similar characteristics.
			Cortez et al (see data source) have created a dataset listing various chemical properties of Portuguese Vinho Verde wines, along with subjective expert evaluations on their quality. This chart demonstrates some of the relationships between chemical properties of red wines and their perceived quality.

		<b>Alcohol:</b> Red wines typically have 9 to 14 percent alcohol. Better wines tend to be stronger.
		<br>
		<b>Volatile acidity:</b> Too much of acetic acid in wine can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar-like taste.
		<br>
		<b>Fixed acidity:</b> Most of the acids in wine are non-volatile, which means they do not evaporate easily.
		<br>
		<b>Citric acid:</b> Small amounts of citric acid can add freshness to the wine.
		<br>
		<b>Sulphates:</b> Potassium sulphate is an wine additive that can increase levels of sulfur dioxide in the wine. The gas acts as a preservative.
		<br>
		<b>Free sulfur dioxide:</b> Free form of sulfur dioxide gas prevents microbe growth and oxidation of the wine.
		<br>
		<b>Total sulfur dioxide:</b> Low amounts of sulfur dioxide in wine are mostly undetectable, but at larger concentrations the taste and nose of the wine can be affected.
